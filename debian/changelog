ros-jazzy-clearpath-tests (2.6.0-1noble) noble; urgency=high

  * Fix expected number of CAN devices for W200 tests (#241 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_robot/issues/241>)
  * Add wireless e-stop test to W200 tests (#240 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_robot/issues/240>)
  * Feature/expand diagnostic test (#236 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_robot/issues/236>)
    * Remove diagnostic exceptions
    * Check for stale diagnostics
    * Ignore mecanum drive bug for now
  * Enable wireless e-stop test on W200 (#226 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_robot/issues/226>)
    W200 includes a wireless e-stop (non-optional) that should be included in the tests.
  * Fix clearpath_tests so they don't crash/hang under certain conditions, remove unnecessary code (#220 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_robot/issues/220>)
    * Add a new class to handle timeouts to reduce duplication
    * Remove node-specific mains, remove .start() from the TestNode class
    * Implement timeout in MCU test so it doesn't hang forever
    * Remove unnecessary functions from canbus test
    * Implement the new timeout for estop tests. Add an abort() method to kill long-running threads so we don't block for too long. Remove unused import
    * Implement new timeout in linear acceleration test
    * Implement new timeout in rotation test
    * Fix a parser error that occurs if wifi is turned off
    * Move motor currents initialization to constructor, call .start() in the linear acceleration test
    * Change how we calculate the IMU inclination; calculate the inclination and calculate the error based on that, rather than percentage error bars based on the vector
    * Fix the logging for the linear acceleration test
    * Test the direction & magnitude of the angular velocity separately. Fix some extra parentheses in the results

  * Re-implement rotation test, add linear acceleration test, add motor-cutoff tests for dingo & jackal (#7 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_tests/issues/7>)
    * Re-implement the rotation test to be an IMU check instead of odometry
    * Re-enable rotation tests for all platforms with an integrated IMU. Add IMU tilt test to Dingo variants
    * Clarified log messages, use consistent accuracy vs error terminology
    * Allow wider margins on the Jackal IMU tests, as it is a component with known lower quality
    * Minor code cleanup & refactoring for consistency
    * Add motor-cutoff tests for Jackal, Dingo
  * Fixed topic of fans test. (#6 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_tests/issues/6>)

  * Fix a bug where the e-stop test could cause the test node to crash
  * Add a 2s delay between clearing the e-stop and moving the wheels to allow CAN reconnections as needed
  * Remove CAN device ID count for platforms that don't use CANopen
  * Lower the time threshold for linear drive test to 0.75 (from 0.8)
  * Change the default serial device for Jackal

  * Allow symlinks to the device handle
  * Fix serial MCU tests
  * Ensure the firmware is 2.3 or higher to allow fan control; otherwise just skip the fan test
  * Add support for lateral driving test for omni platforms (#5 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_tests/issues/5>)
  * Re-enable the fan tests (#4 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_tests/issues/4>)

ros-jazzy-clearpath-tests (0.2.9-1noble) noble; urgency=high

  * Rewrite rotation test (#2 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_tests/issues/2>)
    * Overhaul the logic of the rotation to use an accumulator instead of relying on the latest odom data. Factor in the rate of the EKF + the odometry twist instead of just looking at positional data. On 00005 we're still overshooting slightly, but it's now within the margin of error
  * Append the can interface to the node name to suppress duplicate node name warning
